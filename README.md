## How It Works 🚀
1. **Player Controls**:
   - Move the player paddle using your mouse.
2. The ball moves automatically, bouncing off paddles and walls.
3. A player scores a point if the opponent (computer) misses the ball.
4. The first player to reach the winning score is declared the winner.
5. The background and ball colors transition smoothly through a color cycle, adding a dynamic visual element.
6. The ball speed increases gradually as the game progresses, making it more challenging over time.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **HTML**: Structure of the game canvas and UI elements.
- **CSS**: Styling for the paddles, ball, and overall game layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including ball movement, collision detection, score tracking, computer AI, and color transitions.
